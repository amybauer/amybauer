Hi, I’m Amy.

I am an interdisciplinary researcher interested in taking trait-based and community-level approaches to investigate the effects of changing environments on vector borne disease systems!


- Recent PhD graduate (UF, Dec '24), currently based at the Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory
- Passionate about disease ecology, and ask questions nested in landscape ecology and community ecology (with a side love for disease ecology)
- Data visualization & maps, transparent accessible and reproducible science, and tea make me happy
- Primary working with R (and, less often, QGIS)


Entomology and Nematology (PhD) | Biodiversity, Ecology and Evolution (MSc) | Environmental Monitoring and Analysis (BSc)

Convinced science thrives through collaboration! 
Fluent in: :de: :uk:
